</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.1.3 MCP Completion & Branching Fix (Phases 21-22) - SHIPPED 2026-02-17</summary>

Phases 21-22 wired v0.1.2 CLI commands as MCP tools (102 total) and fixed execute-phase branching to always fork from latest base branch. See `.planning/milestones/v0.1.3-ROADMAP.md` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.1.4 Slash Command Registration & Missing Commands - SHIPPED 2026-02-17</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.1.5 Long-Term Roadmap Redesign (Phases 23-25) - SHIPPED 2026-02-17</summary>

Phases 23-25 replaced the rigid Now/Next/Later tier system with a flat, ordered LT-N milestone model.

<details>
<summary>v0.1.6 Phase Directory Collision Fix (Phase 26) - SHIPPED 2026-02-19</summary>

Phase 26 added milestone-scoped phase directory archival and a validation gate system to prevent phase collisions across milestones. Phase directories are now archived to `.planning/milestones/{version}-phases/` during milestone completion. Pre-flight gates detect orphaned phases, stale artifacts, and milestone state inconsistencies before commands execute.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.2.0 Git Worktree Parallel Execution (Phases 27-31) - SHIPPED 2026-02-19</summary>

See `.planning/milestones/v0.2.1-ROADMAP.md` for details.

</details>

<summary>v0.2.4 Layered Integration (Phase 42) - SHIPPED 2026-02-21</summary>

Phase 42 borrowed best features from competing frameworks (Spec Kit, Agent OS, BMAD, Claude Flow) and integrated them as independent layers: Constitution (PRINCIPLES.md for project principles), Standards Discovery (/grd:discover for extracting codebase patterns), Scale-Adaptive Ceremony (light/standard/full levels controlling agent invocations), and Command Consolidation (45->39 commands). 48 new tests, 1,679 total passing. See `.planning/milestones/v0.2.4-ROADMAP.md` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.2.5 WebMCP Support & Bugfixes (Phases 43-44) - SHIPPED 2026-02-21</summary>

Phases 43-44 added graceful WebMCP integration across execute-phase, verify-phase, and eval-planner workflows. MCP availability detection with `detectWebMcp()` in lib/backend.js, execute-phase WebMCP sanity checks (steps 4b/6b), verifier WebMCP tool discovery (Step 5b), eval-planner WebMCP tool definitions, and code reviewer false blocker fix. All WebMCP features guarded by `webmcp_available` conditional. 1,694 tests passing (15 new). See `.planning/milestones/v0.2.5/` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.2.6 Native Worktree Isolation (Phases 45-47) - SHIPPED 2026-02-22</summary>

Phases 45-47 adopted Claude Code's native `isolation: worktree` via hybrid strategy. Native worktree isolation on Claude Code backend, manual worktree lifecycle preserved for other backends. WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove hooks, executor dual-mode (native/manual), parallel execution adaptation, 4-option completion flow for native branches, agent frontmatter audit. Bug fix: detectBackend(cwd) in parallel.js. 47 new tests, 3 deferred validations resolved live. 1,779 tests passing. See `.planning/milestones/v0.2.6/` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.2.7 Self-Evolution (Phases 48-53) - SHIPPED 2026-02-22</summary>

Phases 48-53 dogfooded GRD on itself: testbed infrastructure, 5 bug fixes (currentMilestone parsing, goal regex, state-snapshot fields, plan-index extraction, underscore mapping), complexity reduction (cmdTracker/cmdDashboard decomposition, 6 dead exports removed), test coverage to 85%+ across all 20 modules, `/grd:autopilot` command for multi-phase autonomous execution, and full integration testing. New module: lib/autopilot.js. 204 new tests, 1,983 total passing. See `.planning/milestones/v0.2.7-ROADMAP.md` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.2.8 Self-Evolving Loop (Phases 54-57) - SHIPPED 2026-02-22</summary>

Phases 54-57 closed the self-evolving loop: markdown splitting infrastructure (lib/markdown-split.js with split/reassemble/index), evolve core engine (lib/evolve.js with discovery across 6 dimensions, state management, merge dedup, priority selection), evolve orchestrator (/grd:evolve command with sonnet-tier model ceiling, evolution notes), and full integration validation (E2E tests, 310 items discovered on GRD codebase, all deferred validations documented). New modules: lib/evolve.js, lib/markdown-split.js. 6 new evolve MCP tools (118 total). 201 new tests, 2,184 total passing. See `.planning/milestones/v0.2.8/` for details.

### v0.3.6 Backend Ecosystem Sync (Active)

Update model mappings, capability flags, and detection logic for all supported backends to reflect the current AI CLI ecosystem as of March 2026.

#### Phase 69: Model Mappings, Capabilities & Detection Updates

**Goal:** All backend model mappings and capability flags in `lib/backend.ts` reflect the current state of each CLI ecosystem (March 2026).

**Dependencies:** None

**Requirements:** REQ-82, REQ-83, REQ-84, REQ-85, REQ-86, REQ-88

**Verification Level:** sanity

**Success Criteria:**

1. `DEFAULT_BACKEND_MODELS.gemini.opus` returns `'gemini-3.1-pro'` (not deprecated `gemini-3-pro`)
2. `DEFAULT_BACKEND_MODELS.gemini.haiku` returns `'gemini-3.1-flash-lite'` (not `gemini-2.5-flash`)
3. `DEFAULT_BACKEND_MODELS.codex.opus` returns `'gpt-5.4'`
4. `DEFAULT_BACKEND_MODELS.opencode` model IDs reference `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5`
5. `BACKEND_CAPABILITIES.gemini.subagents` is `true` (not `'experimental'`)
6. `BACKEND_CAPABILITIES.codex.hooks` and `teams` reflect current Codex CLI capabilities
7. All existing `backend.test.ts` tests pass after constant updates

#### Phase 70: Detection Verification, Tests & Documentation

**Goal:** Backend detection logic is verified against current env vars and filesystem paths, all test assertions match the new constants, and documentation reflects the updated ecosystem.

**Dependencies:** Phase 69

**Requirements:** REQ-87, REQ-89, REQ-90

**Verification Level:** sanity

**Success Criteria:**

1. `detectBackend()` correctly identifies each backend via its env vars (`CLAUDE_CODE_*`, `CODEX_HOME`, `GEMINI_CLI_HOME`, `OPENCODE`)
2. All model mapping assertions in `backend.test.ts` use the updated model names from Phase 69
3. OpenCode capability flags verified against current anomalyco/opencode features
4. CLAUDE.md agent model profiles table references current model names
5. `npm test` passes with 0 failures across the full test suite
6. No hardcoded references to `gemini-3-pro` or `gpt-5.3-codex` remain in the codebase (except test migration comments)

### Progress

| Phase | Name | Status | Requirements |
|-------|------|--------|--------------|
| 69 | Model Mappings, Capabilities & Detection Updates | Complete    | 2026-03-10 |
| 70 | Detection Verification, Tests & Documentation | PENDING | REQ-87, REQ-89, REQ-90 |
