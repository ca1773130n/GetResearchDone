Phases 9-13 delivered multi-backend detection, context init enrichment, hierarchical roadmap planning, milestone lifecycle management, and auto-cleanup quality analysis. See `.planning/milestones/v0.1.0-ROADMAP.md` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.1.1 Completeness, Interoperability & Distribution (Phases 14-18) - SHIPPED 2026-02-16</summary>

Phases 14-18 delivered doc drift detection, deferred validation resolution, MCP server, npm distribution, and end-to-end integration validation. See `.planning/milestones/v0.1.1-ROADMAP.md` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.1.2 Developer Experience & Requirement Traceability (Phases 19-20) - SHIPPED 2026-02-16</summary>

Phases 19-20 delivered requirement inspection commands, phase-detail requirement summaries, planning artifact search, and requirement status management. See `.planning/milestones/v0.1.2-ROADMAP.md` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.1.3 MCP Completion & Branching Fix (Phases 21-22) - SHIPPED 2026-02-17</summary>

Phases 21-22 wired v0.1.2 CLI commands as MCP tools (102 total) and fixed execute-phase branching to always fork from latest base branch. See `.planning/milestones/v0.1.3-ROADMAP.md` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.1.4 Slash Command Registration & Missing Commands - SHIPPED 2026-02-17</summary>

Added /grd:long-term-roadmap and /grd:requirement slash commands, added YAML frontmatter to 28 command files fixing skill registration (all 45 commands now discoverable), updated README command table from 24 to 45 commands.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.1.5 Long-Term Roadmap Redesign (Phases 23-25) - SHIPPED 2026-02-17</summary>

Phases 23-25 replaced the rigid Now/Next/Later tier system with a flat, ordered LT-N milestone model. Complete rewrite of lib/long-term-roadmap.js (18 new functions), 12 new subcommands (list, add, remove, update, refine, link, unlink, display, init, history, parse, validate), 12 new MCP tools (105 total), protection rules for shipped milestones, comprehensive tutorial, and full integration into agents and commands.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.1.6 Phase Directory Collision Fix (Phase 26) - SHIPPED 2026-02-19</summary>

Phase 26 added milestone-scoped phase directory archival and a validation gate system to prevent phase collisions across milestones. Phase directories are now archived to `.planning/milestones/{version}-phases/` during milestone completion. Pre-flight gates detect orphaned phases, stale artifacts, and milestone state inconsistencies before commands execute.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.2.0 Git Worktree Parallel Execution (Phases 27-31) - SHIPPED 2026-02-19</summary>

Phases 27-31 delivered worktree-isolated phase execution with parallel teammate spawning. New modules: lib/worktree.js (lifecycle management), lib/deps.js (dependency analysis with Kahn's algorithm), lib/parallel.js (parallel execution engine). PR workflow from worktrees, sequential fallback for non-Claude Code backends, 7 new MCP tools (112 total), 946-line E2E integration test suite, 144 new tests (1,577 total). See `.planning/milestones/v0.2.0-ROADMAP.md` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.2.1 Hierarchical Planning Directory (Phases 32-36) - SHIPPED 2026-02-20</summary>

Phases 32-36 migrated all `.planning/` subdirectory paths to a strict milestone-scoped hierarchy. New `lib/paths.js` centralized path resolver (9 functions with backward-compatible fallback), all 18 lib/ modules and 60 command/agent markdown files migrated, `migrate-dirs` CLI command for upgrading old-style layouts, simplified milestone archival with `archived.json` marker, test fixtures and golden outputs migrated, 3 deferred validations resolved, 1,631 tests passing (54 new). See `.planning/milestones/v0.2.1-ROADMAP.md` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.2.2 quickDir Routing Fix & Migration Skill (Phase 37) - SHIPPED 2026-02-20</summary>

Phase 37 fixed quickDir() routing bug (hardcoded anonymous instead of current milestone), fixed cmdMigrateDirs quick/ target, and added `/grd:migrate` skill with `grd-migrator` agent for user-facing migration of complex .planning/ layouts. 1,634 tests passing (3 new). See `.planning/milestones/v0.2.2-ROADMAP.md` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.2.3 Improve Settings & Git Workflow (Phases 38-41) - SHIPPED 2026-02-21</summary>

Phases 38-41 unified the git workflow model with project-local worktrees, 4-option completion flow (merge/PR/keep/discard), revised settings interview covering worktree isolation/execution/code-review/gates, and cmdInitNewMilestone phase scanning bugfix. 1,653 tests passing (22 new). See `.planning/milestones/v0.2.3-ROADMAP.md` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.2.4 Layered Integration (Phase 42) - SHIPPED 2026-02-21</summary>

Phase 42 borrowed best features from competing frameworks (Spec Kit, Agent OS, BMAD, Claude Flow) and integrated them as independent layers: Constitution (PRINCIPLES.md for project principles), Standards Discovery (/grd:discover for extracting codebase patterns), Scale-Adaptive Ceremony (light/standard/full levels controlling agent invocations), and Command Consolidation (45->39 commands). 48 new tests, 1,679 total passing. See `.planning/milestones/v0.2.4-ROADMAP.md` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.2.5 WebMCP Support & Bugfixes (Phases 43-44) - SHIPPED 2026-02-21</summary>

Phases 43-44 added graceful WebMCP integration across execute-phase, verify-phase, and eval-planner workflows. MCP availability detection with `detectWebMcp()` in lib/backend.js, execute-phase WebMCP sanity checks (steps 4b/6b), verifier WebMCP tool discovery (Step 5b), eval-planner WebMCP tool definitions, and code reviewer false blocker fix. All WebMCP features guarded by `webmcp_available` conditional. 1,694 tests passing (15 new). See `.planning/milestones/v0.2.5/` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.2.6 Native Worktree Isolation (Phases 45-47) - SHIPPED 2026-02-22</summary>

Phases 45-47 adopted Claude Code's native `isolation: worktree` via hybrid strategy. Native worktree isolation on Claude Code backend, manual worktree lifecycle preserved for other backends. WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove hooks, executor dual-mode (native/manual), parallel execution adaptation, 4-option completion flow for native branches, agent frontmatter audit. Bug fix: detectBackend(cwd) in parallel.js. 47 new tests, 3 deferred validations resolved live. 1,779 tests passing. See `.planning/milestones/v0.2.6/` for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>v0.2.7 Self-Evolution (Phases 48-53) - SHIPPED 2026-02-22</summary>

Phases 48-53 dogfooded GRD on itself: testbed infrastructure, 5 bug fixes (currentMilestone parsing, goal regex, state-snapshot fields, plan-index extraction, underscore mapping), complexity reduction (cmdTracker/cmdDashboard decomposition, 6 dead exports removed), test coverage to 85%+ across all 20 modules, `/grd:autopilot` command for multi-phase autonomous execution, and full integration testing. New module: lib/autopilot.js. 204 new tests, 1,983 total passing. See `.planning/milestones/v0.2.7-ROADMAP.md` for details.
